#### Get Quotes:

```
GET /quotes/list
  ?count=<total-quotes-to-return>
  &page=<page-number>
  &pageSize=<quotes-per-page>
  &tag=<single-tag>
```

Example:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/quotes/list?count=50&page=1&pageSize=10&tag=cool
```

- count: total quotes you want overall
- page: which page of pageSize to return
- pageSize: how many quotes per ‚Äúpage‚Äù (max 50, validated by DTO)
- tag: Filter by specific tag (optional)

On the frontend, enter your desired count in the input box‚Äî infinite-scroll or paging can be built on top of this.

### Frontend Usage

1. Browse Random Quotes: Just open the app to see random quotes
2. Filter by Tag: Enter a tag name in the filter input and click "Get Quotes"
3. Adjust Quote Count: Change the number in the count input
4. Infinite Scroll: Just keep scrolling down to load more quotes
